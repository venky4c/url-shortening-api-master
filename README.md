- This project was implemented in React using React hooks like useState, useEffect. 
- Browser retains state after refresh. This feature uses [localStorage](https://github.com/venky4c/url-shortening-api-master/blob/master/dist/src/components/ShortenList.js) functionality inherently available with all browsers.
